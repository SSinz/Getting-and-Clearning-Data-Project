#Run_Analysis R Script
The Run_Analysis R Script can be categorsied into 5 steps.
  1. Defines the file path.
     Inserts the Features,Subject, and Activity Data into the R Envrionment using the read.table()
  2.Then merges the Row of the data sets using the rbind()
    Thus producing 3 data sets from 6 previous ones.
    Then sets the anmes for the three data sets
    Finally, merges all three data sets into 1 data set
  3.Extracts the measurements that are either standard deviation or mean values
    Then subsets the columns for the feature names using the grep()
  4. Then labels the data through factorising
     Also renames the initial names, using the gsub() by extending the abbreviated names of the variables
  5. Creates a Tidy data set
  
# Files in the Data Set
The initial files: x_test.txt, x_train.txt, subject_test.txt, subject_train.txt, Y_test.txt, Y_train.txt
  These files were then merged, in the 2nd step of the Run_analysis R script.

These files were then merged:
  FeaturedData variable consists of x_test.txt and x_train.txt
  SubjectData variable consists of subject_test.txt and subject_train.txt
  ActivityData variable consists of y_test.txt and y_train.txt

All the aforementioned files were then combined into the Data data set

After the analysis is run, the new tidy data set is produced => DataTidy

#Identifiers in the Data set
- Subject: is the Indicator of the test subject
- Activity: is the type of activity that was performed by the test subjects - and measurements taken
#Activity Labels:
  Walking
  Walking_Upstairs
  Walking_Downstairs
  Sitting
  Standing
  Laying
